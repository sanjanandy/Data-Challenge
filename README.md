# Data-Challenge
Questions to be answered through the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Is the City conducting inspections effectively? Are poorer-performing establishments inspected more often than better-performing establishments? What are the trends over time? 
•	Are there commonalities or trends among establishments that perform poorly?
•	How do establishments perform on re-inspections? How long does it take after an initial inspection for establishments to correct all violations?
•	Do establishments improve their performance on inspections over time? 
•	What changes, if any, would you make to the scoring/grading system to better reflect inspection performance?


Approach:
1. Understand the purpose of the analysis
2. Understand and define the question I want to analyze - “Are there commonalities or trends among establishments that perform poorly?"
3. Go through the data - refer to the data dictionary file, data cleaning
4. Data Preprocessing- Data Cleaning, Data Exploration using MS Excel, Python
5. Data Dashboarding - Utilize the charts to visualize the insights and understand the patterns and trends using Tableau, python
6. Summarize the analysis
